We are sorry for slowing down card parsing in v3.0.0, but this update improves the parsing speed in that regard.

VisualCard has become refreshed, again! This time, in the internals. We've made some of the newsworthy changes that necessitate making a release to bring back performance! As an apology, we've also added features, like better support for nested groups and actual access to `PropertyInfo`.

### Changes

This release contains a variety of changes, including, but not limited to:

- `[+]` Added `PropertyInfo`
- `[+]` Added part dictionary properties (strings, integers, and parts array instances)
- `[+]` Added support for nested property groups
- `[*]` Better support for whitespace padded properties and their arguments
- `[*]` General improvements and bug fixes
